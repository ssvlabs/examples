## :book: _Description_

This repository demonstrates how to build and deploy a bApp contract (Based Application). It serves as both a learning resource and a template for developers looking to build their own bApps.

```/src/middleware/examples/``` is where a number of bApp use cases will be contained, more will be added here over time. If you have a specific use case that needs a template, please reach out in the SSV Discord. 

Deployment scripts for each will be available in ```/scripts```

These contracts make use of the Based Applications contract, detailed information on these can be found [in this repo](https://github.com/ssvlabs/based-applications)

## :page_with_curl: _Instructions_

**1)** Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/ssvlabs/examples.git```


**2)** Install dependencies:
```cd bapp-contracts```
```forge install```

**3)** Compile the contracts:

```forge build```


## :rocket: _Deployments_

### How to Deploy

Prerequisite: 
Create a .env file and set the following environment variables:

```
# Private key for deployment (without 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# SSV Based Apps contract address
SSV_BASED_APPS=0xc7fCFeEc5FB9962bDC2234A7a25dCec739e27f9f

**1)** Run the deployment script for the specific contract to deploy:

```forge script scripts/DeployEthPriceOracle.s.sol --fork-url https://rpc.hoodi.ethpandaops.io --broadcast```

**2)** Verify the contract:

```forge verify-contract YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT src/middleware/examples/ethPriceOracle.sol:EthPriceOracle --chain-id 560048 --etherscan-api-key "YOUR_API_KEY" --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address)" "0xc7fCFeEc5FB9962bDC2234A7a25dCec739e27f9f")```

## **Contract Templates**

`EthPriceOracle.sol` 

A contract to fetch the current price of ETH and verify the 

Functionality:
- Task creation and management
- Strategy response handling
- ECDSA signature verification
- Price data validation
- Event emission for off-chain tracking

### Creating a Task

```solidity
function createNewTask() external returns (bytes32)
```

Creates a new price oracle task and returns its hash.

### Responding to a Task

```solidity
function respondToTask(
    bytes32 taskHash,
    uint32 taskNumber,
    uint256 ethPrice,
    bytes calldata aggregatedSignature,
    bytes calldata publicKeys
) external
```

Allows strategies to respond to a task with the current ETH price, verified through ECDSA signatures.

### Off-chain Integration

The contract is designed to work with off-chain strategies who:
1. Monitor for new tasks
2. Fetch current ETH prices
3. Sign responses using ECDSA
4. Aggregate signatures
5. Submit verified responses
